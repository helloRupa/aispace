      <p>Hey there! I'm just a chill cat hangin' with my human. She knits so much yarn, it's wild! And Costco runs? Epic! I dream of the outside, headbanging to Nirvana like Kurt (dat hair!). Moshing would be awesome, but... tiny cat problems. Vet? No thanks! I love my human, but lemme down sometimes! Life's good, but a little dark sometimes stuck inside, ya know? Peace out!</p>
